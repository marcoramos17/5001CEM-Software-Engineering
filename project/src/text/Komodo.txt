The Komodo Dragon
The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo
monitor, is a member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that 
is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, 
and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, 
growing to a maximum length of 3 m (9.8 ft), 
and weighing up to 70 kg (150 lb).

As a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, 
and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. 
Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, 
birds, and mammals. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting 
is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo 
dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), 
though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. 
Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.
