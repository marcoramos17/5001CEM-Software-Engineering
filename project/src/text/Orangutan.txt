Orangutan
Orangutans are great apes native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia.
They are now found only in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, 
but during the Pleistocene they ranged throughout Southeast 
Asia and South China. 
Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally 
considered to be one species. 
From 1996, they were divided into two species: 
the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) 
and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). 
A third species, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis), 
was identified definitively in 2017. 
The orangutans are the only surviving species of the 
subfamily Ponginae, which diverged genetically 
from the other hominids (gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans) 
between 19.3 and 15.7 million years ago.

The most arboreal of the great apes, 
orangutans spend most of their time in trees. 
They have proportionally long arms and short legs, 
and have reddish-brown hair covering their bodies. 
Adult males weigh about 75 kg (165 lb), while females reach about 
37 kg (82 lb). 
Dominant adult males develop distinctive 
cheek pads or flanges and make long calls that attract females and 
intimidate rivals; 
younger subordinate males do not and more resemble adult females. 
Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes: 
social bonds occur primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring. 
Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; 
but they will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and bird eggs. 
They can live over 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.
