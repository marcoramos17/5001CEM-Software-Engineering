Anoa
Anoa, also known as dwarf buffalo and sapiutan,
are two species of the genus Bubalus, placed within the subgenus 
Anoa and endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia: 
the mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) and the lowland anoa 
(Bubalus depressicornis). 
Both live in undisturbed rainforest and are similar 
in appearance to miniature water buffaloes, 
weighing 150–300 kg (330–660 lb).

Both species of anoa have been classified as endangered 
since the 1960s and the populations continue to decrease. 
Fewer than 5,000 animals of each species likely remain. 
Reasons for their decline include hunting for hides, 
horns and meat by the local peoples and loss of habitat 
due to the advancement of settlement. 
Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas.
